sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: In the best case scenario (numbers already sorted) it uses less time to run. However, in the worst case scenario (numbers reversted) it uses much more time than sort2 meaning that it is not a merge sort.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: In the worst case scenario (numbers reversed) it uses the least time to have the numbers sorted. Also, the time spent to run the program on both best and worst scenarios are similar.
